I'm competent at bass guitar, tuba, euphonium and several strange-looking traditional Chinese instruments. I have experience in playing jazz, soul/funk/pop and rock. [Get in touch with me](/contact) if you're looking for a bassist, tubist or euphoniumist (yes, that *is* a word) for an evening or weekend gig in London or the surrounding area!

I also serve at my church, [Christ Church Mayfair](https://christchurchmayfair.org/), where I play bass guitar, keys and acoustic guitar and occasionally mix the sound.
