I was formerly President of the [Imperial College Department of Computing Society (DoCSoc)](https://docsoc.co.uk), who are brilliant at recruiting student software developers for you. If you're looking for really bright interns or grads for the not-too-distant future, give them a shout about sponsorship! They also organise [IC Hack](https://ichack.org) - Imperial College London's main annual hackathon, and the largest student-run hackathon in the UK!
