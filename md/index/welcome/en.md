Hello there! I'm a full-stack software engineer based in London.

I'm currently working for [Thought Machine](https://www.thoughtmachine.net/) as a Front End Engineer, helping to build modern retail banking technology.

I recently graduated from Imperial College London with an MEng degree in Computing. I also used to do a bit of music stuff and could be persuaded into doing a bit more.
